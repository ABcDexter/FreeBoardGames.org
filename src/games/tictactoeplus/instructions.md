Tic-Tac-Toe-Plus (ttt+) is a nice varaint of the classis Tic-Tac-Toe. In ttt+, there is a 4x4 board (vs. 3x3 in classic) and the game is played by two players. 

Usually, the 4x4 varaint of the classic game is considered baised or leads to a draw. In order to over come this limitation, ttt+ introduces a wildcard symbol - namely the "plus" symbol, which represent both a circle and a cross. Each time a player takes a turn, a dice is rolled to decide it the wildcard is shown or not, wherein a wildcard will be shown if the dice-outcome evaluates to 6. And, for a given game, the wildcard (or the plus) can appear only upto a maximum of 3 times.
