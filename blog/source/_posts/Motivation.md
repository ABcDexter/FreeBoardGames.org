Board games are an increasingly popular way to have fun with friends. However, this intellectually stimulating leisure activity is only widespread in specific regions of the world. Before moving to one of these regions, I was not even aware they existed. This project wants to change this reality, by increasing the availability of board games, and making them easier to play remotely. Even though nothing will ever replace the real life experience of sitting with friends in the same room, we can leverage the ubiquity of mobile devices in order to make playing board games a more common activity around the world.

Creating digital versions of board games is a very common hobby for developers, but most of these efforts are siloed and fragmented. The idea of this project is to create the necessary infrastructure to make it easy for the community to develop high-quality board games implementations for mobile devices. By making the project free (as in freedom) and joining efforts with others like [Boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io) we hope that, together, we can make a positive impact in the world, showing how fun and intellectually stimulating board games can be.

Therefore, this blog will contain materials like tutorials and other fun stuff related to [turnato.com](https://turnato.com) and [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io) :). Soon we will post a tutorial on how to develop a simple game, battleship, leveraging the boardgame.io framework, and publishing it to turnato.com.
